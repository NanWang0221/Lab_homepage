Welcome to Meta-self Lab!

The lab aims to probe into the essence of self, employing meta-analytic tools and modeling methods. Transparency and reproducibility are at the core of our research, as we replicate important studies, re-examine key findings and redefine concepts. We do, and only do, rigorous and robust science. 

Equality is another core value of our lab. We are dedicated to fostering a culture where everyone is respected and every idea is valued. Regardless of your gender, ethnicity, or academic background, you're welcomed to join our quest for truth.
